# Smart-farming
This is a proposal of a semi-automated farm where are implemented sensors (for light, moisture and temperature) with compactable actuators. They all send data to controler which then communicate with userapp on phone. When human request he gets information such as soil moisture, amount of light and temperature height. Then if necessary he can set the actuator to correct any of this data.
